/// A class that defines the characteristics and properties of a single character for OCR processing.
///
/// The [CharacterDefinition] class stores various attributes of a character including its visual
/// representation through matrices, structural properties like enclosures, and categorical information
/// such as whether it's a letter, digit, or punctuation mark.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final charDef = CharacterDefinition(
///   character: 'A',
///   isLetter: true,
///   matrices: [Matrix(...)],
/// );
/// ```
///
/// Key features:
/// * Supports JSON serialization/deserialization
/// * Stores multiple matrix representations of the character
/// * Tracks character properties like enclosures and line presence
/// * Categorizes characters (letter, digit, punctuation, etc.)
/// * Maintains standard template dimensions (60x40)
///
/// This class is fundamental to the Textify OCR system, providing the template
/// definitions used for character recognition and matching.
class CharacterDefinition {
  /// Creates a new [CharacterDefinition] instance.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [character]: The character this definition represents. This parameter is required.
  /// - [enclosures]: The number of enclosures (e.g., brackets, parentheses) associated with this character. Defaults to 0.
  /// - [isAmount]: Indicates whether this character is typically used in monetary amounts. Defaults to false.
  /// - [isDate]: Indicates whether this character is commonly used in date representations. Defaults to false.
  /// - [isDigit]: Indicates whether this character is a numerical digit. Defaults to false.
  /// - [isLetter]: Indicates whether this character is an alphabetic letter. Defaults to false.
  /// - [isPunctuation]: Indicates whether this character is a punctuation mark. Defaults to false.
  /// - [lineLeft]: Indicates whether this character typically has a line to its left (e.g., in handwriting). Defaults to false.
  /// - [lineRight]: Indicates whether this character typically has a line to its right (e.g., in handwriting). Defaults to false.
  /// - [matrices]: A list of matrices representing the visual pattern of this character. Defaults to an empty list.
  ///
  /// All parameters except [character] are optional and have default values.
